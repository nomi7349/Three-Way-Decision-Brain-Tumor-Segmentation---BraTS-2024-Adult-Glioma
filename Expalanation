The segmentation is done by introducing a new layer in the encoder of a 3D u-net architecture. This new layer contains three-way decision block that focuses on identifying boundary pixels of tumor and its regions. 
The data is from BraTS 2024 Synapse Challenge for Post Treatment Adult Glioma. The dataset contains 3D scans of MRI of 1350 patients. Each scan contains 4 modalities of tumor and its sub-regions and one mask file in NifTI format. The 3-way block helps CNN to learn about the pixels, patterns, colors at the boundary regions in a three-way i-e; three decisions about a single pixel rather it is a boundary pixel, it is not a boundary pixel or mixed decision. This block decides through a threshold defined in a three-way rather than a binary decision like traditional two-way classification i-e; yes or no.
